# MiamiHousing
Miami Housing Market Sales Price Estimater

This Streamlit web application predicts housing prices in Miami using pre-trained Linear Regression and Random Forest models. Users can input property features, receive price predictions, and view data insights.

Features

- Predicts sale prices using two models: Linear Regression and Random Forest
- Accepts user input for key housing features such as land area, age, location, and structure quality
- Provides model performance metrics: RÂ², MAE, RMSE
- Includes data visualizations:
  - Histogram of sale prices
  - Correlation heatmap
  - Scatter plots of top predictive features
